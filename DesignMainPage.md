We use a free open-source Doxygen [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) program generation tool, which can convert specific comments in the program into a description file. The use of Doxygen can be divided into two parts. The first part is to write comments in a specific format, and the second is to use it to generate documents.

For this project, we are using Doxygen to produce a Software Design Document (SDD).

For this project, we are using Doxygen to document traceability from design to requirements.
